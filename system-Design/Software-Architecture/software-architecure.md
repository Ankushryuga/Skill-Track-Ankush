## Software architecure consists of one,two,three & N-tier architecure:

# Here "tier" means "layer":

1. Presentation layer: This layer is responsible for displaying user interface and manage user interaction, main function of this layer is to communicate with application layer.


2. Application layer: OR Logice layer, This layer is interface between presentation layer and data layer. Takes input from user and store the data in Data layer and then process data layer and gives output to presentation layer back.

3. Data layer: This layer responsible for storing data, application layer send data to data layer for further processing.

4. Service layer: This layer responsible for providing services.


##  1-Tier Software Architecture: AKA Standalone application, Presentation, Application & Data layer reside on sample place. Example MP3, and MS office.

##  2-Tier Software Architecture: AKA Client-Server application, Presentation and Application layer comes on client and Database comes in Server layer.

##  3-Tier Software Architecture: AKA Web-Based Application, Presentation Layer(Frontend), Application Layer(Backend), and Data Layer(Database).

##  N-Tier Software Architecture: Similar to 3-Tier Software Architecture, but it have distributed system each sub distributed system have its on tier.
